# Introduction

pyqudt is a Python library for working with QUDT units and convertions between them. It is based on jQUDT, a similar Java library.

QUDT is "Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Data Types in OWL and XML".

# Installation

```
pip3 install pyqudt
```

# Status

The package is relatively complete and test cases cover most code. Version 1.0.0 has been released.

# Quick demo

Keep in mind, these conversions are purely derived from data in the QUDT ontology.

Source:

```python
from qudt.quantity import Quantity
from qudt.units.concentration import ConcentrationUnit
from qudt.units.temperature import TemperatureUnit

obs = Quantity(0.1, ConcentrationUnit.MICROMOLAR)
print(f'{obs} = {obs.convert_to(ConcentrationUnit.NANOMOLAR)}')

temp = Quantity(20, TemperatureUnit.CELSIUS)
print(f'{temp} = {temp.convert_to(TemperatureUnit.KELVIN)}')
```

Output

````
0.1 Î¼M = 100.00000000000001 nM
20 degC = 293.15 K
````
